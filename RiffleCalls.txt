The following are calls that will need to be implemented across the Riffle
between Player and Dealer and Player and Exec:

Player -> Dealer
void receiveCard(Card)
Card dealCard(Player)
void czarPick(Card)
bool isCzar(Player)
void prepareGame(Context) //bad apple
void setPlayers()
ArrayList<Card> getNewHand(Player)
ArrayList<Card> getSubmitted()
Card getQuestion()
void removePlayer(Player)
void receiveCard(Card)
void addPlayer(Player)

Player -> Exec
Dealer findDealer(bool)
int getNewID()
void addPoint(Player)
